    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Monostage Space Systems is here to change the paradigm of spaceflight, acting to accelerate the new space global economy. Ascent and reentry capabilities have been treated as separate design systems. Monostage will blend these capabilities to create a novel heavy lift, fully reusable ascent-reentry vehicle, projecting to bring launch costs down to <b>$500per kg</b>. Leveraging legacy pre-flight data, current advancements in computer aided engineering, and additive manufacturing, we aim to address commercial bottlenecks, secure space domain awareness, and provide versatile mission applications.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our perspective is that the design of launch vehicles need to evolve beyond the conventional missile-style airframe that has been in use since the <b>V2 rocket in the 1940s</b>. The inherent disposability of missiles has been carried over to modern launch vehicles, which needs to be addressed to reduce and eliminate space debris.  </p>
    <br>  
    <p>To carry massive payloads greater than <b>200,000 lbs</b> to low earth orbit, we aim to go wider, not taller. Monostage is innovating towards the inevitable, as advanced space transportation vehicles will have full mission lifecycle capability. To be <b>100% reusable</b> and leave zero net debris in space, we first designed our airframe for atmospheric reentry. Just as airplanes operate, our vehicle platform lands, poised for immediate reuse. Downmass is becoming a fast growing market for microgravity experiments and space manufacturing, and we estimate more than <b>55,000</b> lbs downmass capability with our single stage to orbit vehicle platform. </p>
    <br>  
    <p>Monostage Space Systems believes it is paramount for the national security of our nation that the US Space Force acquires a vehicle for critical mission objectives. With a letter of support from the US Space Force Space Systems Command - Monostage is on a mission to build a fleet of vehicles capable of providing rapid responsive services to maintain space domain superiority.</p>
    <br>  
    <p>Our vision is to be the backbone transportation platform that helps industrialize the space economy, with an ecosystem of modular vehicles supporting a variety of domains. Beyond the commercial launch, cargo downmass, on orbit and lunar operations, Monostage will help expand the national security of the United States of America, providing an industry-changing multi-billion dollar opportunity.</p>
