    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Monostage Space Systems is here to change the paradigm of space flight- blending separate design systems together into a high cadence, 100% reusable ascent-reentry vehicle. Our vehicle platform will support super heavy payloads to low earth orbit (LEO) of over 90,000 kg at a cost of roughly $500 per kg.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Monostage is innovating towards the inevitable, as advanced space transportation vehicles will have full mission lifecycle capability. Our vehicle platform operates like an aircraft, poised for immediate reuse without the need of complex infrastructure for staging.</p>
    <br>  
    <p>Our perspective is that the design of launch vehicles need to evolve beyond the conventional missile-style airframe that has been in use since the V2 rocket in the 1940s. The inherent disposability of missiles has been carried over to modern launch vehicles, which hinder payload scalability and must be addressed to eliminate space debris.</p>
    <br>  
    <p>For complete reusability, we first designed our single stage airframe for atmospheric reentry. Our analysis shows downmass capabilities of more than 25,000 kg, enabling bulk delivery services from space to Earth.</p>
    <br>  
    <p>Our vision is to be the backbone transportation platform that helps industrialize the space economy. As a dual use mobility hardware company, Monostage will help expand the national security of the United States of America while providing an industry-changing multi-billion dollar opportunity. As we scale, Monostage will develop an ecosystem of modular vehicles supporting the commercial launch, cargo downmass, on orbit, lunar operations, and moreâ€¦</p>
